# Lunar
C# port of the original DEC PDP-8 game written in FOCAL by Jim Storer in 1969

This is buggy ATM, I'm not getting the same results as the original for given inputs. Unfortunately I do not know what order of operations were followed in the PDP-8 FOCAL system.

Yes, if you've ever used an older (pre DOS/Windows) PC you may have encoutered this, they didn't always follow the proper order of operations for math requiring you to add () in order to make 2+3\*4 = 24 rather than 20...
